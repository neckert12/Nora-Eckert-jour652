<h5 class="byline"> The critical role of halfway houses in the criminal justice system </h5>

<h3> For those in recovery from addiction or recently incarcerated, having a supportive community can be the most important part of successfully reintegrating into society. Often, this community is provided through a halfway house. However, if the facility is not properly run, it can be the critical tipping point for these individuals to recidivate or overdose. </h3>

  <h2 class="chapter"> <img src="house.png" class="house"><a name="reform">A System in Reform</h2>

  <p>The problems with the halfway house system in the U.S. are certainly not new, but they have increased in the past two years. Due to former Attorney General Jeff Session’ resistance to the First Step Act, halfway houses are being used at a decreasing rate, the exact opposite goal of said Act.</p>

  <p>The First Step Act is a prison reform initiative backed by President Donald Trump aimed at reducing recidivism through increasing halfway house use and other alternatives to incarceration. Session argued that for financial reasons, halfway houses should not be used. Instead of increasing their role in the criminal justice system, he aimed to decrease direction to halfway houses.</p>

  <p>Sessions’ financial argument is not supported by a 2016 report by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which states that the federal government spends about $36,000/year to house an inmate, a dramatically higher cost than the $4,000 required to house an individual in a halfway house. (Source)</p>

  <p>Even when halfway houses are treated as an integral part of the criminal justice system, poor conditions can limit residents’ progress, evening causing some to feel unsafe. A New York Times report on New Jersey halfway houses found that after encountering violence or sexual abuse, inmates often asked to be brought back to prison, because they felt it was a less dangerous environment (Source).</p>

<h2 class="chapter"> <img src="house.png" class="house"><a name="regulation">Regulation: The Key or the Problem?</h2>

<p>Even when halfway houses are treated as an integral part of the criminal justice system, poor conditions can limit residents’ progress, evening causing some to feel unsafe. A New York Times report on New Jersey halfway houses found that after encountering violence or sexual abuse, inmates often asked to be brought back to prison, because they felt it was a less dangerous environment (Source).</p>

<p>The Tampa Bay Times reported that several Florida halfway houses were being run by criminals, some as a cover to pay for drugs or abuse residents. This report cited a lack of regulation as the cause of this problem.</p>

<p>The situation in Florida calls into question the larger issue of what governmental bodies are tasked with regulating halfway houses and how do they do so.</p>

<p>Halfway houses are regulated by The Americans with Disabilities Act and 1968 Federal Fair Housing Act. According to the Federal Act, “it is illegal under the Act for local land use and zoning laws to exclude or limit group homes for individuals with specific types of disabilities.” Substance abuse is classified as such a disability.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Act does not exclude based on “fear, speculation, or stereotype about a particular disability or persons with disabilities in general.” Therefore, a group of offenders cannot be discriminated against for a history of medical illness or abuse. However, exclusion based on  criminal record is allowed under the act.</p>

<p>As is evident in the cases of mismanagement of halfway houses in Florida, regulation of halfway houses is difficult and often dysfunctional on a state level.</p>

<p>However, some individuals who are involved with halfway houses say that lack of regulation is a strength, because they have more freedom to fit residents’ needs.</p>

<p>In Maryland, alone, there are dozens of halfway houses to choose from. How can a family or individual make a decision about what the best facility is for their needs if there is not consistent regulation?</p>

<h2 class="chapter"> <img src="house.png" class="house"><a name="regulation">A Personal Journey</h2>

<p>A personalized approach to recovery is essential for the success of many former addicts, says Jo Black Sullivan, The Program and Fundraising Specialist for Nick’s Place, a halfway house in Beltsville, Maryland.</p>

<p>“The disease itself does not always lend to a lot of empathy from the outside world. But trust me, when you’re suffering from it, you’re suffering from a disease. The company you surround yourself with in recovery, they understand that. They understand the shame. They know the shame that you feel. No one judges you. They embrace your shame and help love you through it,” said Sullivan.</p>

<p>Cathy Bradley, Sullivan’s mentor, went through the halfway house system herself when she was in recovery. She said the sense of community she had in that process was essential for her development.</p>

<p>“To know that I’m not alone and to hear others’ vulnerability makes me feel not alone. For me, I was in a miserable dark and lonely place for so many years. When I heard other people tell my story, I was like, ‘You get it.’”</p>

<p>The two most deadly shootings in modern American history occurred within the last few years. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting killed 26 people. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School killed 17. The deadliest school shooting in U.S. history occurred in 1927 in Bath Township, Michigan when a school board treasurer killed 38 elementary school students and six adults.</p>

  </a><b><h2>About the data</h2></b><br/>
<p>School shooting data is surprisingly messy and hard to come by. There are few government or academic studies on the subject and those that do exist are mostly outdated. Further, school shooting data tends to be messy and hard to deal with. According to The Atlantic, the parameters of school shooting incidents makes data inconsistent.</p>
